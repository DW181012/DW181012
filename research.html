    <p>Collective Bird Flights</p>
    <p1>Birds are often found to fly collectively. In fact, many species of birds, such as pelicans, flamingoes and cranes, often fly in a linear formation. 
    Focusing on the horizontal dynamics under the effect of heaving motion, we posed a math model comprising of a system of Delayed Differential Equations to 
    describe interactions among the birds within the flock. Through simulating our model, we reproduce results which agrees qualitatively with past experimental
    findings from NYU Applied Math Lab. Currently, we are applying analytical and computational methods to study the flock stability of collective flights.</p1>

    <p>Hydrodynamics of Finite-length Pipes at Intermediate Reynolds Numbers</p>
    <p1>How does water or beverage liquid flow from the lower tip to the upper tip when we are sipping through a drinking straw? A general answer is that the pressure 
    difference generates the flow through the straw, but many different hydrodynamic laws exist to model such flow: for example, the Hagen-Poiseuille Law characterizes 
    the laminar flow generated in a long thin pipe with flow rate scaling linearly with pressure drop; the Torricelli describes the flow generated through a short fat 
    orifice with pressur drop scaled quadratically by the flow rate; and the full Navier-Stokes Equation can be applied to study the fully developed turbulent flow 
    through a long fat tube. Hence, it remains to be figured out which flow regime does the flow through a straw fall into.
    <br><br>
        One may characterize the conditions under which those laws apply respectively by two dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds Numbers, which is proportional with 
    the flow rate, and the aspect ratio of the length of a pipe over its effective radius. Yet, a survey within NYU Applied Math Lab shows that the data in terms of the 
    parameters do not fall into any of those flow regimes, meaning that such flow has to fall into a completely new law. Hence, we carried out experiments to test the 
    flow through steel pipes of various aspect ratios, and straws made of paper or plastic for drinking coffee, soda and bubble tea. Analyzing the data, we built a math 
    model by breaking down the pressure drop through the development of the flow. Excitingly, this model can be applied to predict the hydrodynamic properties of a flow 
    through a pipe in all four regimes, including the three well-studied regimes and the newly found one.
